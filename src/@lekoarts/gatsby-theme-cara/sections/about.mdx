## About

Third-year computer science student, future data scientist. My passion for data science introduced me to DataCamp an online learning platform, where I learned Data Science through R & python. Last semester I completed the Big Data Analytics course as a part of my Open elective, which covers several important topics such as Data Science life cycle, impact & influence of big data on the current business models and also the insights into being a Data Scientist.

The most valuable lesson I have learned is that for a person to achieve success one should have sound knowlege on fundamentals be it any field of study. Even though I wanted to be a data scientist, I have enjoyed exploring other fields of computer science. My class in Foundational Skills in Integrated Poduct Development (FSIPD) has provided me with great insights on product development and various agile models implemented by various software companies. I love being curious and am always eager to learn new things. I am also interested in cloud computing. I do fun projects in IoT

This year I have learned about web technologies and web development as a part of my curriculum. I have done my internship this year at NRSC (National Remote Sensing Centre). Doing an internship at NRSC gave me a wonderful industry exposure and hands on approach to various tecnologies, it also helped me fine tune and develop my skils in web development and GUI design. I will continue to build my skills in data science and improve my skill-set. Next year, after compelting my bachelors degree i wish to pursue my higher studies abroad which would help me achieve my dream of getting an enduring scholastic capability and also experience important technological skills.
